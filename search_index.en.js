It allows\nthe creation of interned strings (symbols) from literals in the code with\npractically zero overhead.\nThe current state of things\nNormally, creating an interned string from a literal in code involves the\nfollowing steps:\n\nAcquire a global lock on some symbol registry.\nDetermine if the string is already present in the registry.\nIf so, return the existing ID or pointer.\nOtherwise, allocate the backing storage for the symbol and insert it in the\nregistry.\n\nAll of this means that creating symbols in code is something you don't want to\ndo in inner loops, or you may want to avoid it if you are scared of \"death by a\nthousand cuts\". In particular, the need to acquire a global lock or other\nsynchronization primitives every time is quite the impediment.\nHow Stringleton does it\nInstead, Stringleton uses a novel approach with some cooperation from the\nlinker:\n\nEvery call site of sym!(...) is statically registered at link time, using\nlinkme::distributed_slice. This creates a small \"symbol table\" in the\n.bss section of the resulting binary.\nWhen the process starts, all entries in the symbol table are \"reconciled\",\neffectively performing steps 2 through 4 of the above (using the ctor\ncrate).\nWhen actually reaching the sym!(...) call site, it compiles into a single\nmemory load.\n\nThe real kicker here is that the memory load at the call site does not even\nneed to be atomic. The reason this is safe and sound is that static initializer\nfunctions (ctor) are guaranteed to execute before main(), and therefore\nbefore any threads can possibly have started. In other words, by the time\nmain() starts executing, the symbol table is already fully initialized, and it\nis never modified again in the lifetime of the process.\nThe caveat is, of course, that using sym!(...) in another static initializer\nfunction is not safe.\nGenerated code\nConsider this function:\n\nThis compiles into a single load instruction. Using cargo disasm on x86-64\n(Linux):\n\nFor the uninitiated, that's a plain non-atomic memory load. Most notably, there\nare no function calls or locks acquired.\nLife before main(), a diatribe\nThe general assumption in Rust is that nothing happens before main(). This\nisn't actually true, and it's worth considering what the nature is of that\nassumption.\nStatic initializer functions (or static constructors) fall in a weird kind of\ngrey area when it comes to safety. The big question is: Is safe code in\nmain() allowed to rely on the invariant that static initializers have run\nbefore main()?\nThe answer currently seems to be a resounding maybe. It would be a useful rule,\nas this crate demonstrates, but at the same time, static constructors is a\nlinker feature that may not be guaranteed to exist everywhere. In C, they\nrequire nonstandard attributes. In C++ they are guaranteed to execute before\nmain(), but esoteric configurations may forbid it.\nMultiple things in the standard library do not work inside static\nconstructors, but some things do: alloc and atomic synchronization primitives\nlike OnceLock. It is unclear whether the things that don't work are guaranteed\nto always fail in safe ways.\nAll #[ctor] static initializer functions should be fundamentally considered\nunsafe, but not in the normal sense, because it isn't about the function's\npreconditions (the function itself may be perfectly safe), but rather about\nwhether the function relies on the implicit precondition that static\ninitializers have run. In other words, the semantics are inverted: The function\nmay be unsafe to call in a static initializer, even though it only invokes safe\nAPIs, because those safe APIs may rely on other static initializers having\nfinished.\nIn effect, the \"unsafe\" part of a static initializer function is the fact that\nit is being called before main(), and that any function may rely on static\ninitializers having actually completed.\nBefore Edition 2024, Rust had no way of expressing this inversion, but now we\nhave \"unsafe attributes\". An example of this is no_mangle, which is now\nspelled #[unsafe(no_mangle)]. The reason it matters for no_mangle is that\ndefining a global symbol with a particular name may shadow other symbols with\nthe same name (on some platforms). It can effectively override some arbitrary\nfunction, given the right linker flags, and that is deeply unsafe for obvious\nreasons. On Linux and macOS, there are even official ways to do this: The\nLD_PRELOAD environment variable explicitly allows overriding symbols from an\nexecutable with symbols from a dynamic library, which is another example of a\nthing that \"happens before main()\".\nThe ctor crate does not yet require #[unsafe(ctor)], but it hopefully\nwill.\n","id":"https://simonask.github.io/introducing-stringleton/","title":"Introducing Stringleton"},"https://simonask.github.io/introducing-werk/":{"body":"Introducing Werk 💅\nI made a thing.\nwerk is a simplistic build system, similar to make, and a command runner,\nsimilar to just. It tries to be very easy to use, and religiously portable.\nThis is a general overview. For a more detailed explanation of syntax and\nbehavior, please consult the project's README.\nThe source code for werk is available on GitHub.\nCheck out the book and the\nexamples.\n\nCaution:\nwerk is alpha software. Features may be buggy or missing. It may\neat your code. Use at your own risk. Commit everything before trying it out. Consider\ntrying it out in a virtual machine first. Don't blame me if you didn't.\n\nJust immediately, Why?!\nThe motivation for werk is that make is annoying. Make is a very\nsophisticated tool that solves a bunch of problems I don't have, and doesn't\nsolve many problems that I do have.\nMy personal use case - highly specific, but far from unique:\n\nI'm building a video game. Video games have a complex build process, because\nthey contain both code and assets.\nIteration speed is important.\nSome assets are code:\n\nWASM plugins built by Cargo.\nShaders built by glslc and slangc. Shader compilation is slow, so\nprecise dependency tracking (depfiles) is important.\n\n\nNative Windows support is a hard requirement.\nWhen it doesn't do what I want, I need to be able to understand why.\n\nWhy not Make?\nHere's an incomplete list of problems I have with make:\n\nI want to use file names and paths that contain spaces.\nI want build rules and \"housekeeping\" workflows to not interact in surprising\nand bad ways (.PHONY).\nI want to work natively on Windows, as well as Linux and macOS. You can get\nGNU Make to sort of work using layers of emulation, but fundamentally it's a\nbad experience. Specifically, Makefiles typically rely on the presence of\nexternal POSIX utilities, like sed, awk, and so on, and all of these\ninteract in undesirable ways with Windows filesystems.\nI want to put build artifacts in a separate directory.\nI want to use glob patterns in my build scripts (reliably), and I want them to\nbe .gitignore-sensitive, like all the other tools we use.\nIn general, file modification times are just insufficient in determining\noutdatedness.\nI want variables, lists, strings, and other things we expect of contemporary\nlanguages.\nI want to be able to diagnose my build process.

I tried various things, including expression build\nrules declaratively in TOML. werk actually still supports this mode, mainly\nfor testing. But it quickly becomes very unwieldy to express the kind of\nthings you really want to express in build scripts.\nIt sucks, I know, but I promise it's fairly pleasant and readable.\n\nExample building C program\nHere's a minimal Werkfile to build a C program.

Contributions are welcome, but ultimately it is\ndesigned to address my personal use cases. If you believe it should also address\nyour use case, please feel free to get in touch.\nIn defense of getting sidetracked\nDid I have to make werk? Not really. I could have made GNU Make work for my\npurposes. In fact, I did for a long time. On top of that, I'm trying to deliver\na video game, one of the notoriously hardest thing to actually finish.\nThe most challenging thing about finishing a video game as a solo developer is\nto stay motivated. There are many problems that are hard to solve, and that's a\nbig part of the fun, but it's also a constant pull on my creativity. That's both\nexciting and incredibly draining.\nToughing it out and powering through does not work. What works is to take a\nbreak, step away from the trenches, and let the creative juices stew in the\nbackground for a while.\nDoing little side projects that feel useful - and hopefully contribute a bit to\nthe broader ecosystem - is a distraction, but it's also a way to stay healthy\nand productive, and combats the feeling of isolation.\nRust\nAs you may have guessed, werk is written in Rust, and it leans into\nasync/await for managing concurrency. It's no secret that Rust is my current\nfavorite language, and I use it for almost everything. I want to share why.\nHow was Rust helpful?\n\nWe're running things in parallel, and Rust ensures that there are no\nsynchronization bugs or race conditions, period.\nWe're invoking external commands, so controlling errors and failure modes is\nimportant. We don't want to abruptly kill a process just because one of its\nsiblings failed.\n\nThere's a couple of uses of unsafe in the entire project, all trivial\none-liners with guaranteed semantics (transparent reference casting), mostly\nrelated to converting between werk_fs::Path and str.\nShout-out to the dependencies that made things significantly easier, and their\nauthors: which, globset, winnow, clap, and smol.\n","id":"https://simonask.github.io/introducing-werk/","title":"Introducing Werk"},"https://simonask.github.io/libyaml-safer/":{"body":"Porting libyaml to Safe Rust: Some Thoughts\nThe following is a loose collection of thoughts that came up while porting\nunsafe-libyaml to safe, idiomatic Rust, which may be useful to someone else\nwho is considering \"rewriting it in Rust\", as the ancient journeyman prayer\ngoes.\nSome context: YAML is a commonly used markup language, similar to JSON, and\nthe primary way that Rust programmers interact with it is through serde_yaml,\na serializer/deserializer implementation targeting YAML through the very popular\nSerde framework, which is backed by an almost verbatim machine translation of\nthe C libyaml library into unsafe Rust, called unsafe-libyaml. The\ntranslation is made with c2rust, with only minor fixes applied manually.\nIn my case, I was in a situation where I needed to interact with YAML in a way\nwhere serde_yaml came up short. Specifically I needed input location markers\noutside of error messages to support diagnostics and debugging in the context of\na game, where the AI behavior trees are defined in YAML files.\nBut the unsafe libyaml API is actually pretty unwieldy to use from Rust, even\nwhen translated to Rust code, because it behaves exactly like the C code, so it\nis no different than calling out to an actual C library with FFI. So I - perhaps\nfoolishly, in a flash of manic youthful optimism - decided to embark on the\njourney of porting unsafe-libyaml to safe Rust, function by function, line by\nline. It took a little over a week.\nThe result is available on GitHub.\nUpdate 2024-02-09: libyaml-safer has now been published to\ncrates.io as well.\nWhat are we dealing with?\nlibyaml consists of two main components:\n\nYAML parser, which consumes a stream of bytes and produces \"events\"\nrepresenting the structure of the document.\nYAML emitter, which consumes a stream of events and produces a stream of\nbytes.\n\nThe byte streams, both input and output, can be in different encodings, one of\nUTF-8, UTF-16 little-endian, or UTF-16 big-endian. Most, but not all, Unicode\ncode points are supported - notably, control characters are not supported.\nEvents in libyaml are a linear representation of the logical structure of a\ndocument, so higher level than parser tokens, but lower level than mappings,\nsequences, and scalar values. Events are things like \"begin mapping\", \"begin\nmapping key\", \"scalar\", etc.\nLibyaml also contains a high-level abstraction, yaml_document_t, which can\nrepresent any YAML document. The parser can load a stream of events into a\ndocument, and the emitter can produce a stream of events from a document.\nEldritch Horrors, or just C\nlibyaml is squarely a C library, and reading it from the point of view of a\nRust programmer, there is a beautiful insanity to it all. It hails from a\nsimpler time, where concepts like ownership, mutability, and the fabric of\nreality were up for debate.\nIt isn't \"wrong\", just different. Unnecessarily difficult in many ways, but in\nother ways refreshingly straightforward, so long as you can keep the cosmic\nhorror only just barely out of sight.\nString Theory\nYAML is a human-readable format, and any parser for it must deal with a lot of\nstrings. Thankfully, libyaml does the sane thing and defines its own string type\n- which almost every single C library in existence does, and even many larger\nC++ libraries - and sometimes they don't even contain very many bugs. I swear\nthe history of the world would have looked very, very different if our venerable\nforebears had extended their otherwise infinite benevolence to the inclusion of\na sane string type with the standard C library, but again I digress.\nThis is the string abstraction in libyaml:\n\nThe start and end fields seem straightforward: A pointer to the beginning of\nthe string and a pointer to one-past-the-end of the string. So far so good. But\nwhat about pointer? Some places in the code it is used as the actual end of\nthe string (so end is actually the end of the allocated capacity of the\nstring), and in others it is used as the actual start of the string, so start\nis the beginning of the underlying allocation, and pointer is used to iterate\nover bytes or substrings of the string.\nWhat's going on here?\nIt turns out that this data structure serves multiple different purposes\nsimultaneously: It is both &amp;str, String, and std::slice::Iter, all in one.\nSometimes it is even the std::str::Chars iterator, which is used to iterate\nover full UTF-8 codepoints within the string. The only way to determine which\nabstraction it is currently emulating is to look at the context.\nThankfully - libyaml being a well-structured C project - there are plenty of\ncontext clues. When the STRING_DEL() macro is being used, the caller assumes\nownership. When the STRING_ASSIGN() macro is being used, the string is being\nborrowed and/or used as an iterator.\nThe interesting takeaway is this: For all of the different roles that\nyaml_string_t takes on, it turns out there is an abstraction in the Rust\nstandard library that matches each use case precisely. At all points in the\nlibyaml source code where strings are used, the use case maps directly to one of\nthe several many ways of dealing with strings in Rust. Phew!\nJoyful aside: There is a similar type in libyaml, called yaml_buffer_t. It\nis slightly more complicated than strings, because it acts essentially as a ring\nbuffer, and it turned out to be almost very close to a VecDeque from the\nstandard library. Hooray!\nSelf-referential types - Oh my!\nYAML syntax can represent the same thing in multiple ways. For example,\nsequences and mappings can be represented in both \"flow style\" and \"block\nstyle\", and strings can be single-quoted, double-quoted, unquoted, block-quoted,\netc.\n\nThe libyaml emitter wants to choose both nice and correct formatting for the\noutput. Not just for the aesthetic, but also because some things actually\nrequire specific styles - for example, escape sequences are only supported in\ndouble-quoted strings, and some Unicode characters need to be represented as\nescape sequences.\nThe emitter works by pushing \"events\" to a queue. Events are things like \"begin\nmapping\", \"begin mapping key\", \"begin mapping value\", \"end mapping\", and so on,\nand the emitter writes to the output when it has enough information to determine\nthe appropriate style.\nThis is implemented in libyaml as an \"analysis\" step that happens for each event\nbefore the corresponding YAML is written to the output.\n\nThe analysis step populates the emitter-&gt;anchor_data, emitter-&gt;tag_data, and\nemitter-&gt;scalar_data fields depending on the event type. Those fields that can\nbe NULL are C strings, and they refer to the strings contained within the\nevent. But the event comes from a queue owned by yaml_emitter_t. This is\ngreat design in the C library, because it makes the analysis step extremely\ncheap - no strings are duplicated, only \"borrowed\".\nSo how do we express the analysis fields in safe Rust? Blindly porting the C\napproach to Rust would result in yaml_emitter_t becoming self-referential,\nsince the analysis pointers would either point into the event queue or into an\nevent that was just popped from the queue, making it impossible to represent\nthat lifetime on yaml_emitter_t itself.\nKey Insight: Every time yaml_emitter_analyze_event() is called, it resets\nany previous analysis results. It is called exactly once per event. Aha! What if\nthe results of the analysis was a return value from\nyaml_emitter_analyze_event(), instead of modifying fields on the emitter?\n\nWonderful! Now the Analysis&lt;'a&gt; struct just needs to be passed into any\nemitter function that needs the analysis as an extra parameter. Thankfully no\npublic API function on the emitter relies on analysis having happened\npreviously, so threading that argument through the emitter code is fairly\ntrivial, and guaranteed bug-free due to lifetime annotations, in the sense that\nit is not possible for any part of the emitter to use the analysis of one event\nduring the emission of another event.\nOn the one hand, this change is something that we're forced to do by Rust,\nbecause it would not be possible to make the borrow checker happy without it. On\nthe other hand, the Rust compiler actually nudges us to choose a better design\nthan the original.\nWhy is this beneficial? Why do we accept such blatant tyranny by the cruel and\ncold-hearted borrow checker?\nWell, see, reading the original source code for libyaml was hard. Upon seeing\nthe anchor_data, tag_data, and scalar_data fields of yaml_emitter_t, the\nfirst thing any reader or maintainer has to do is figure out how those pointers\nare used and when they are valid. This required a whole bunch of forensics,\nwhich would have to happen again and again every time someone new looked at the\ncode, and \"someone new\" also includes \"future you\".\nThe original design from the C code could have been ported verbatim to Rust. But\nit would require a lot of unsafe code, which would have made it very obvious\nthat some cognitive overhead was being incurred. By choosing a design that works\nin safe Rust, that cognitive overhead has been moved to a statically verified\ninvariant that is plainly visible in the source code. The new signature of\nyaml_emitter_analyze_event plainly documents that Analysis&lt;'a&gt; contains\nreferences that are coming from a yaml_event_t with lifetime 'a.\nError handling\nOne of my goals with libyaml-safer was to provide near perfect error fidelity\ncompared with libyaml.\nMercifully, C does not have exceptions. They are easily among the top 20 of\nhumanity's mistakes, and don't even come for me because I will die on this hill.\nInstead, C code usually reports errors by returning an error code, and this is\nalready a primitive version of what Rust does. The flow around error handling is\nsurprisingly similar between well-structured C code and idiomatic Rust code.\nRust has the \"try\" operator ? to make things easier, and one of the important\naffordances of unsafe-libyaml (Rust) over libyaml (C) is that integer return\ncodes are replaced with a bespoke Success struct. Replacing this with\nResult turned out to be pretty\ntrivial.\nBut wait a minute... We can't just use the ? straight away. It checks if an\nerror occurred and returns early from the function if it did, but C does not\nhave RAII, so resources need to be released as well before returning. This is\nthe one remaining valid use case of goto in the C language, and it is often\nactually the most sustainable way to deal with errors. More civilized languages\n(such as Rust) don't even have this misfeature.\n\nThus, in order to start leveraging the error handling features of Rust, all\nthings that own memory must first be converted to RAII objects, such as\nString, Vec, VecDeque, etc.\nAfter that, there is the problem of actually reporting the error.\nRust Results are rich: They can contain an error value of your choice, so you\ncan provide the best possible message for the users, giving them all the context\nthey need. C does not have this option built in, and most libraries opt for\nsimply returning an error code, and then sometimes allowing the programmer to\nobtain more information about the error after the fact.\nIn libyaml, this looks like so:\n\nWhen an error occurs, the relevant function (such as yaml_parser_parse()) sets\nthe error fields (yaml_set_parser_error()), and returns an integer indicating\nthat an error occurred. The user is then expected to access these fields to\ndetermine what the error was and where in the input it occurred.\nIn Rust, we don't want a special \"error\" state for the parser. Ideally, we want\nto be able to return a self-contained error instead, which can then have all the\nusual niceties, like an implementation of std::fmt::Display.\nNote also that the reported error is not necessarily a \"parse error\". Lots of\nerrors can occur that aren't typically considered syntax errors: I/O read\nerrors, invalid Unicode, tokenization errors, etc.\nLet's try with some enums:\n\nSo nice, perfect fidelity and high-quality error reporting. Except... On a\n64-bit architecture, the size of the top-level ParserError enum is 88 bytes,\nmostly due to the Mark type, which indicates a location in the input, and\nwhich looks like this:\n\n24 bytes, and each error typically needs 2 marks.\nWhy is the size a problem?\n\nEven the minimal Result&lt;(), ParserError&gt; can never be returned in a register.\nEvery function that encounters a Result&lt;T, ParserError&gt; and wants to return\nResult&lt;U, ParserError&gt; needs to re-wrap the return value, no matter if an\nerror occurred or not, leading to a lot of copying of large structs in stack\nmemory.\nWhile LLVM will inline calls to memcpy() below 128\nbytes,\ninstructions to copy these values are still generated.\n\nThe parser makes a huge number of tiny calls, and each of them can fail. Every\ntime it needs a new token, it might also need a new character, meaning it might\nalso need another byte from the input buffer, meaning it might also need to\nperform a read() operation from the input, which can fail with\nstd::io::Error, or with a Unicode decoding error, or with a tokenization\nerror, and finally a parser error.\nAll in all, a very large error type like this is... not great.\nThere are a couple of options for moving forward:\n\nMimic the libyaml style of errors, and set error codes on the parser object\nitself. This gives a much less ergonomic API, or would introduce a lifetime\nparameter on all return values that isn't very nice.\nCodegolfing the above enums to reduce the size. Not much can be won without\nlosing fidelity, but it could probably get down to about 64 bytes.\nWrap the error in a Box, reducing the size to only 8 bytes on 64-bit\nplatforms. The heap allocation isn't great, but it would only happen in error\nscenarios, so it's trading some efficiency in the error path for a faster\n\"happy\" path.\nAccept that this is our life now and move on.\n\nAll compromises, either in usability or performance.\nI benchmarked options (3) and (4) against each other in the happy path, and\nthere wasn't much difference. But it still feels wrong, and committing to an\n\"inefficient\" public API where the user can see the inner workings of the error\nenums is a semver hazard, so for now I've chosen an API that supports both\nimplementations, and boxed (3) under the hood.\nZooming out, it's worth noting that\nserde_yaml::Error\nhas actually chosen (3), a boxed error, which is an indication that I am not the\nonly person in the world in considering this an acceptable tradeoff.\nFreebies\nRust, being a younger language, has a much richer standard library. This means\nthat several things that are implemented manually in libyaml can be replaced\nwith standard facilities.\n\nUTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding/decoding. These aren't particularly complicated, but\nthe Rust standard library is likely to be better optimized (for example, using\nSIMD when available).\nRather than user-provided unsafe callbacks, input and output can be handled by\nthe std::io::Read and std::io::Write traits. This gives users the ability\nto plug anything in there, such as tty streams, network streams, etc., with no\nextra effort.\nThe parser requires some input buffering to perform correct decoding, but\nlibyaml is practically forced to do this by itself, even when the input is\nalready buffered by the user. By using the std::io::BufRead trait, an entire\nintermediate buffer was eliminated from the parser, meaning that if the data\nis already coming from an in-memory buffer, the unnecessary copy is elided.\n\nTesting\nunsafe-libyaml is automatically tested against the official YAML test\nsuite. Having this comprehensive test\nsuite was an absolute necessity when porting to safe Rust, and I would not have\ndared to embark on this endeavor without it.\nFor every change to the code, I was able to run the full test suite and verify\nthat everything was as it should be. And even though the code was ported with a\ntrue dedication to matching the original semantics, and even the general \"shape\"\nof the API, many things could go wrong - particularly around flow control and\nerrors. See, the use of gotos is emulated by c2rust using complicated\nloop/match/break constructs, all of which went away completely, replaced by\nRust's \"try\" operator, ?. Even trivial changes are an opportunity for bugs to\nsneak in, and even moreso when there are hundreds.\nEven though it is much easier to write correct code in safe Rust than in C,\nlogic bugs are obviously just as possible, particularly when performing very\nlarge scale refactoring.\nPerformance\nIn order to compare the performance of unsafe-libyaml and the safe Rust port, I\nfound a relatively large YAML document (~700 KiB) and built a very simple\nbenchmark using Criterion.\nIn short:\nunsafe-libyamllibyaml-safer\nParse 700 KiB document38.258 ms37.447 ms\nEmit 700 KiB document18.491 ms17.549 ms\n\nHold for applause.\nThese benchmarks were run on an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X 16-Core CPU (3.5 GHz) running\nWindows 11.\nAnalysis\n\nImportant: While I do consistently get slightly faster times for\nlibyaml-safer, I don't consider this benchmark to be conclusive in any way.\nWhat these numbers do indicate is that the port to safe, idiomatic Rust does\nnot produce meaningfully slower code.\n\nThe justification for \"unsafe\" C and C++ libraries is often that some\nperformance is left on the table with safe Rust, primarily due to bounds\nchecking. On modern hardware this justification has always seemed a bit\nsuspicious to me, and I think this is another piece of (circumstantial)\nevidence that it often just doesn't matter in practice.\nIt's certainly possible to build things where bounds checking makes a\ndifference. This just isn't that.\n\n\nIf libyaml-safer is consistently faster for all workloads, here are some\npossible explanations:\n\nC libyaml needs to assert on a couple of invariants (such as pointers not\nbeing NULL), and unsafe-libyaml performs these assertions even in release\nmode. Some of these invariants are statically checked in safe Rust, where\n&amp;T can never be \"NULL\".\nDue to the use of std::io::BufRead in the parser, the parser performs\nfewer in-memory copies.\n\n\nEven if this benchmark is completely bogus, the performance of libyaml-safer\nis still well within tolerance for what is acceptable, considering the massive\nincrease in maintainability and safety\nZero effort was made to optimize things, other than just not choosing\nobviously slower safe alternatives.\n\nOne optimization that might make sense is to implement more efficient\nlookahead in the parser. Currently, there are many places where the scanner\nand parser perform many redundant bounds checks on the input buffer.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was a lot of fun.\nI think, to me, and to a lot of software engineers who came from a C++\nbackground, using Rust is not just about nebulous promises of safety and\ncorrectness.\nIt's about bringing the joy back into programming.\nWe all like to design pretty, user-friendly APIs, we all like to produce things\nthat just feel high quality. Many of us don't get to do that, because the\nrealities of our industry often do not permit it. And so, does it spark joy?\nCoding in Rust feels like having your cake and eating it too. When people are\nproductive in Rust, it is because it makes many things that used to be hard -\nthings that cause tears, blood, and burnout - are no longer as hard. The result\nis not just safer and easier, it is also just as performant. So please - join\nus.\nFootnotes\n\nIn this post I have preserved type names and function names from\nunsafe-libyaml, but as part of porting to idiomatic Rust, I also did\nrename all types and enums following idiomatic Rust conventions.\n\n","id":"https://simonask.github.io/libyaml-safer/","title":"libyaml-safer"}},"docInfo":{"https://simonask.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://simonask.github.io/about/":{"body":45,"title":0},"https://simonask.github.io/introducing-stringleton/":{"body":456,"title":2},"https://simonask.github.io/introducing-werk/":{"body":589,"title":2},"https://simonask.github.io/libyaml-safer/":{"body":1837,"title":2}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
