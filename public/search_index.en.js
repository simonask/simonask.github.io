simplistic build\nsystem, similar to make.\nThis is a general overview. For a more detailed explanation of syntax and\nbehavior, please consult the project's\nREADME.\nThe source code for werk is available on\nGitHub.\nCheck out the examples.\n\nCaution:\nwerk is alpha software. Some features may be buggy or missing. It may\neat your code. Use at your own risk. Commit everything before trying it out. Consider\ntrying it out in a virtual machine first. Don't blame me if you didn't.\n\nJust immediately, Why?!\nThe motivation for werk is that make is annoying. It's a very sophisticated\ntool that solves a bunch of problems I don't have, and doesn't solve many of the\nproblems I do have.\nMy personal use case - highly specific, but far from unique:\n\nI'm building a video game.\nSome of the assets (WASM plugins) are built by Cargo.\nOther assets (shaders) are built by glslc and slangc. Shader compilation\nis slow, so precise dependency tracking (depfiles) is essential.\nThe assets for the game are built \"offline\" into a custom asset pack format.\nAssets, including WASM code, can be hot-reloaded by the engine.\nWindows support is a hard requirement.\nWhen it doesn't do what I want, I need to be able to understand why.\n\nHere's an incomplete list of problems I have with make:\n\nI want to use file names and paths that contain whitespace.\nI want build rules and \"housekeeping\" commands to not interact in surprising\nand bad ways (he's a big fat .PHONY!).\nI want to work natively on Windows, as well as Linux and macOS. You can get\nGNU Make to sort of work using layers of emulation, but fundamentally it's a\nbad experience. Specifically, Makefiles typically rely on the presence of\nexternal POSIX utilities, like sed, awk, and so on, and all of these\ninteract in bad ways with Windows filesystems.\nI want to put build artifacts in a separate directory.\nI want to use glob patterns in my build scripts (reliably), and I want them to\nbe .gitignore-sensitive.\nI want to be able to diagnose my build process. The output of make -d is\nunreasonable.\n\nHere's a 100% exhaustive list of problems I have with just (seriously, it's\ngreat, but):\n\nIt can't build things, only run commands.\nWhen you do anything fancy you generally need a shell, making Justfiles\nnon-portable.\n\nHere's a loose collection of problems I have with other purportedly\ncross-platform tools:\n\nninja: Too low-level, not nice to write by hand, very specialized for C/C++.\nscons: Very clunky in my opinion, annoying Python runtime dependency.\nrake: Ruby straight up does not work on Windows.\ncargo xtask: Only runs commands (\"workflows\"), similar to just.\ncargo script: Solves a different problem.\ncmake: I'm too traumatized already.\nAll the Java tools (gradle, maven, bazel): I'm sorry, I can't.\n\nInstallation\nThe only supported distribution method for werk is cloning the repository from\nGitHub and building it from source. If this is a problem for you, werk probably\nisn't a tool for you.\nThe only system dependencies are rustc and cargo.\n\nDesign\nwerk parses a TOML file containing \"recipes\", determines what the user wants\nto build, what the dependencies are, and runs programs to rebuild any outdated\nbuild products in the right order.\n\nWhy TOML? I don't want to write an LSP server. Who has the time.\n\n\nWhy not YAML? I actually like YAML, and it would be easy to add support,\nbut one crucial difference between the two is that YAML does not support\n\"reopening\" a mapping, so commands and recipes could not be expressed as\nnaturally between each other.\n\n\nWhy not JSON or XML? Neither is human-readable. Change my mind, I dare\nyou to try.\n\nExample\nHere's a minimal werk.toml to build a C program:\n\nIt's a regular TOML document, except that werk also parses string values\ncontaining interpolations {...} or &lt;...&gt;.\nExample run:\n\nOutdatedness / Staleness\nThe heart and soul of any build system. Targets are considered outdated under a\nnumber of conditions:\n\nFile modification time. If an artifact is older than its prerequisites,\nit will be rebuilt.\nGlob patterns. If a target takes the result of a glob operation (like\nsrc/*.c) as its input, werk detects when the result changed (including if\nfiles were deleted!), and rebuilds the target(s) that depend on the result.\nEnvironment variables. If a target depends on the value of an environment\nvariable, it will be considered outdated if the value changes between runs.\nwhich lookup. If a target recipe uses a program that is found via the\nPATH environment variable, the target will be considered outdated if the\npath to the program changes.\n\nTracking glob results and environment variables requires some knowledge, other\nthan filesystem timestamps, to be transferred between runs. Werk writes a\n.werk-cache file to its output directory containing only enough information to\ndetermine whether things changed. Environment variables are hashed, so your\nsecrets should be safe, but be careful.\nWerkspace &amp; Output Directory\n\"Workspace\" refers to the directory containing werk.toml and its\nsubdirectories, but not including any file or directory mentioned by\n.gitignore, and not including the output directory.\n\"Output directory\" refers to the location of build artifacts. werk will only\never write to files within this directory, and puts .werk-cache in its root.\nIf werk detects a file named .werk-cache in the workspace (i.e., it exists\nwithin a directory not mentioned by .gitignore), that is a hard error for your\nprotection.\n\nwerk can use the same output directory as other build tools, like\ncargo, but it doesn't try to avoid overwriting files generated by\nother tools. Do this with caution.\nNote: In the case of cargo, using the same output\ndirectory also means that cargo clean will remove all build artifacts\nproduced by werk, including .werk-cache.\n\nFilesystem\nFilesystem paths are just fundamentally not portable between Unix-like systems\nand Windows. Let's be honest - Windows is very weird. Using backslash \\ as the\npath separator is just the start. Some file names are outright banned. Bet\nyou didn't know that Windows will yell at\nyou if\nyou try to read or create a file called, say, com¹.txt (not a footnote - the\nsuperscript ¹ is illegal when preceded by com, COM, cOm, or CoM,\nregardless of the file name extension).\nSo even though Windows also does support using / as the path separator (unless\nthe path is \"canonical\" - this rabbit hole goes deep!), the set of legal\nfilesystem paths is just different.\nwerk ensures portability of your build scripts by introducing abstract paths,\nwhere:\n\nThe path separator is always forward slash /.\nPaths can only contain valid UTF-8. Incomplete UTF-16 pairs on Windows, or\nabitrary byte sequences on Linux and macOS, will cause an error.\nFile and directory names must be valid on all platforms, so creating\ncom¹.txt on Linux or macOS will also fail.\nPaths are always relative to the workspace root (the directory containing\nwerk.toml) or the output directory. Paths cannot refer to files outside of\nthe workspace.\nPaths are unambiguous: /foo/../bar.txt will always be reliably resolved as\n/bar.txt.\nAny abstract path can be losslessly converted to a native OS filesystem path\non all platforms.\n\nAll input files and build artifacts are represented by an abstract path. Glob\nexpressions produce a list of abstract paths.\nThis is well and good, but werk's main purpose is to execute other programs to\nproduce artifacts. These programs expect native OS paths. This is solved during\nstring interpolation, where there is a difference between \"{path}\" and\n\"&lt;path&gt;\".\n\n\"{path}\" will interpolate the abstract path as-is, verbatim.\n\"&lt;path&gt;\" will interpret path as an abstract path, and convert it to an\nabsolute native OS filesystem path within the workspace or the output\ndirectory, depending on whether it is generated by a recipe or exists in the\nworkspace.\n\nRunning other programs\nUniquely, werk does not pass commands through a native shell, like sh or\nPowerShell. Instead, werk spawns processes directly in code (using\ntokio::process::Command).\nI think this is a good idea because:\n\nPOSIX-like shells are not available on Windows, so build scripts relying on\nthem are not portable.\nShell semantics differ wildly between platforms. For example, glob patterns\nare expanded by the shell on POSIX, but on Windows they are passed literally\nas an argument to the process, so the program must perform its own glob\nexpansion.\nConstructing a command line invocation that results in the same command in all\nshells is incredibly error-prone. For example, if an argument contains spaces\nit must be quoted, and if it contains quotation marks, those must then be\nescaped, and what's the precise syntax for that?\nHandling PATH resolution in-process (instead of delegating to a shell) means\nwe can track outdatedness.\n\nThe drawback is that shell features, such as stdio piping, are not available.\nThat's also kind of by design - again, piping works differently on different\nplatforms. werk does not currently provide an alternative to piping between\nprocesses, but may do so in a future version.\nDepfiles\nMany build tools and compilers understand and produce \"depfiles\", usually with\nthe file extension .d. These are in the Makefile format, and are designed to\nbe @included in a Makefile.\nwerk has native support for parsing depfiles, including depfiles generated by\nbuild recipes, and automatically adds dependencies from depfiles to a target's\ndependencies if the depfile key is present in the recipe. (See the example\nabove.)\nControlling side effects: I/O sandboxing\nTesting something like werk is challenging because there are fundamentally\nmany moving parts, especially external programs and files on the hard drive.\nAt the same time, the \"dry run\" mode is an essential feature, which also tries\nto guarantee that modifications to the filesystem do not occur.\nwerk allows switching out the interface to the \"real\" system, such that every\nside effect (writing files, spawning child processes) can be eliminated at\nruntime. This feature is used both by the --dry-run mode, but also to test all\nof the internal logic of werk without requiring filesystem access.\n\nNote: Side effects in --dry-run are considered bugs,\nbut werk is alpha software and probably contains bugs.\n\nVariables\nwerk supports variables and expressions.\n\nGlobal variables are defined in the [global] section of werk.toml, and\ntheir values are available to all recipes. Additionally, their values can be\noverridden from the command line, using werk --define key=value.\nRecipe-local variables are defined in a recipe-local table, vars, and are\nevaluated before running any commands.\nImplicit variables while evaluating expressions.\n\nIn the example above, cc and ld are global variables, and ld has the same\nvalue as cc.\nPlease consult the README for more details.\nStrings &amp; Interpolation\nStrings within werk.toml are interpreted according to a custom string\ninterpolation DSL, loosely inspired by format strings in Rust.\nString interpolation is specially suited for shell commands. When building a\ncommand-line string, werk automatically handles quoting and whitespace in the\nway you might expect.\nOne particular feature of string interpolation is path-sensitivity.\n\n\"{var}\" interpolates the value of var verbatim.\n\"&lt;var&gt;\" interprets var as an abstract file path, and converts it to an\nabsolute native filesystem path.\nBoth flavors can apply operations during interpolation, such as replacing a\nfile extension: \"{var:.c=.o}\".\nWhen a variable is a list (such as a list of input files), it can be expanded\nas {var*}, which will produce a string with each element of the list\nseparated by a space. If var contains other lists, it will be expanded\nrecursively (flat map).\nWhen an interpolation operation is present along with a list expansion, the\noperation is applied (recursively) to each element of the list. Example: \"&lt;var*:.c=.o&gt;\".\n\nIn string interpolations, some automatic variables are available, with mnemonics\nbased on Make for convenience. For example, \"{%}\" interpolates the stem of the\npattern that was matched in the current recipe, if any.\nPlease consult the README for more details.\nExpressions\nWhen a variable is a TOML table (inline or block-style), it will be interpreted\nas an expression, depending on the keys that are present in the table.\nExpressions may be composed, or derived from other variables.\nExpression evaluation tracks \"outdatedness\" as well. If a recipe uses a variable\nthat is derived from, say, an environment variable that changed since the last\nrun, the target is considered outdated.\nExamples of expressions:\n\n{ glob = \"pattern\", ... }: Apply the glob pattern to the workspace and get a\nlist of matching files.\n{ which = \"program\" }: Determine the absolute native OS filesystem path to\nprogram.\n{ env = \"NAME\" }: Read environment variable.\n{ shell = \"command\" }: Run command and capture its output. Confusingly,\nthis doesn't actually invoke the system's shell, just the program.\n{ ..., match = { 'foo' = \"...\", 'bar' = \"...\" } }: Pattern-match against an\ninput and conditionally evaluate the result.\n{ ..., patsubst = { pattern = \"...\", replacement = \"...\" } }: Apply a\npattern-substitution to the result of another expression.\n\nPlease consult the README for more details.\nModes\nwerk can be invoked in different modes to understand and diagnose what's\nhappening.\n\n--dry-run: Do not run any commands or write any files. Note that --dry-run\nimpedes depfile support, because werk cannot build the depfiles, so\ndependencies found in those may be stale or nonexistent.\n--explain: For every target being rebuilt, explain in the terminal why\nwerk decided it was outdated. The explanation includes all reasons that a\ntarget was outdated, including cached information about the environment. This\noption tries very hard to be as user-friendly as possible, while still giving\na full picture.\n--print-commands: Print external command line invocations as they are being\nexecuted, or would have been executed in a dry-run.\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nImportant:\nwerk is an LGBTQIA+ program (yes, all of them). You can use it freely,\nexcept if you personally are homophobic, biphobic, transphobic, or support any politician\nor work for any organization that harms or opposes minority rights. Otherwise, we love\nyou and support you. 💖\n\nImplementing werk has been very fun. As you may have guessed, it's written in\nRust, and it leans into async/await with Tokio for managing concurrency.\nI'm used to writing code where performance is a high priority, but for a tool\nthat is kind of fundamentally \"heavy\", in the sense that its purpose is to\ninvoke much more heavy-duty programs such as compilers, it doesn't make a lot of\nsense to spend time on shaving off those microseconds. Joyfully, Rust was still\na very good choice here.\nHow was Rust helpful?\n\nWe're running things in parallel, and Rust ensures that there are no\nsynchronization bugs or race conditions, period.\nWe're invoking external commands, so controlling errors and failure modes is\nimportant. We don't want to abruptly kill a process just because one of its\nsiblings failed.\n\nThere's 3 uses of unsafe in the entire project, all trivial one-liners with\nguaranteed semantics (transparent reference casting), all related to converting\nbetween werk_fs::Path and str.\nShout-out to the dependencies that made things significantly easier, and their\nauthors: which, globset, winnow, clap, and not least, tokio.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/introducing-werk/","title":"Introducing Werk"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/libyaml-safer/":{"body":"Porting libyaml to Safe Rust: Some Thoughts\nThe following is a loose collection of thoughts that came up while porting\nunsafe-libyaml to safe, idiomatic Rust, which may be useful to someone else\nwho is considering \"rewriting it in Rust\", as the ancient journeyman prayer\ngoes.\nSome context: YAML is a commonly used markup language, similar to JSON, and\nthe primary way that Rust programmers interact with it is through serde_yaml,\na serializer/deserializer implementation targeting YAML through the very popular\nSerde framework, which is backed by an almost verbatim machine translation of\nthe C libyaml library into unsafe Rust, called unsafe-libyaml. The\ntranslation is made with c2rust, with only minor fixes applied manually.\nIn my case, I was in a situation where I needed to interact with YAML in a way\nwhere serde_yaml came up short. Specifically I needed input location markers\noutside of error messages to support diagnostics and debugging in the context of\na game, where the AI behavior trees are defined in YAML files.\nBut the unsafe libyaml API is actually pretty unwieldy to use from Rust, even\nwhen translated to Rust code, because it behaves exactly like the C code, so it\nis no different than calling out to an actual C library with FFI. So I - perhaps\nfoolishly, in a flash of manic youthful optimism - decided to embark on the\njourney of porting unsafe-libyaml to safe Rust, function by function, line by\nline. It took a little over a week.\nThe result is available on GitHub.\nUpdate 2024-02-09: libyaml-safer has now been published to\ncrates.io as well.\nWhat are we dealing with?\nlibyaml consists of two main components:\n\nYAML parser, which consumes a stream of bytes and produces \"events\"\nrepresenting the structure of the document.\nYAML emitter, which consumes a stream of events and produces a stream of\nbytes.\n\nThe byte streams, both input and output, can be in different encodings, one of\nUTF-8, UTF-16 little-endian, or UTF-16 big-endian. Most, but not all, Unicode\ncode points are supported - notably, control characters are not supported.\nEvents in libyaml are a linear representation of the logical structure of a\ndocument, so higher level than parser tokens, but lower level than mappings,\nsequences, and scalar values. Events are things like \"begin mapping\", \"begin\nmapping key\", \"scalar\", etc.\nLibyaml also contains a high-level abstraction, yaml_document_t, which can\nrepresent any YAML document. The parser can load a stream of events into a\ndocument, and the emitter can produce a stream of events from a document.\nEldritch Horrors, or just C\nlibyaml is squarely a C library, and reading it from the point of view of a\nRust programmer, there is a beautiful insanity to it all. It hails from a\nsimpler time, where concepts like ownership, mutability, and the fabric of\nreality were up for debate.\nIt isn't \"wrong\", just different. Unnecessarily difficult in many ways, but in\nother ways refreshingly straightforward, so long as you can keep the cosmic\nhorror only just barely out of sight.\nString Theory\nYAML is a human-readable format, and any parser for it must deal with a lot of\nstrings. Thankfully, libyaml does the sane thing and defines its own string type\n- which almost every single C library in existence does, and even many larger\nC++ libraries - and sometimes they don't even contain very many bugs. I swear\nthe history of the world would have looked very, very different if our venerable\nforebears had extended their otherwise infinite benevolence to the inclusion of\na sane string type with the standard C library, but again I digress.\nThis is the string abstraction in libyaml:\n\nThe start and end fields seem straightforward: A pointer to the beginning of\nthe string and a pointer to one-past-the-end of the string. So far so good. But\nwhat about pointer? Some places in the code it is used as the actual end of\nthe string (so end is actually the end of the allocated capacity of the\nstring), and in others it is used as the actual start of the string, so start\nis the beginning of the underlying allocation, and pointer is used to iterate\nover bytes or substrings of the string.\nWhat's going on here?\nIt turns out that this data structure serves multiple different purposes\nsimultaneously: It is both &amp;str, String, and std::slice::Iter, all in one.\nSometimes it is even the std::str::Chars iterator, which is used to iterate\nover full UTF-8 codepoints within the string. The only way to determine which\nabstraction it is currently emulating is to look at the context.\nThankfully - libyaml being a well-structured C project - there are plenty of\ncontext clues. When the STRING_DEL() macro is being used, the caller assumes\nownership. When the STRING_ASSIGN() macro is being used, the string is being\nborrowed and/or used as an iterator.\nThe interesting takeaway is this: For all of the different roles that\nyaml_string_t takes on, it turns out there is an abstraction in the Rust\nstandard library that matches each use case precisely. At all points in the\nlibyaml source code where strings are used, the use case maps directly to one of\nthe several many ways of dealing with strings in Rust. Phew!\nJoyful aside: There is a similar type in libyaml, called yaml_buffer_t. It\nis slightly more complicated than strings, because it acts essentially as a ring\nbuffer, and it turned out to be almost very close to a VecDeque from the\nstandard library. Hooray!\nSelf-referential types - Oh my!\nYAML syntax can represent the same thing in multiple ways. For example,\nsequences and mappings can be represented in both \"flow style\" and \"block\nstyle\", and strings can be single-quoted, double-quoted, unquoted, block-quoted,\netc.\n\nThe libyaml emitter wants to choose both nice and correct formatting for the\noutput. Not just for the aesthetic, but also because some things actually\nrequire specific styles - for example, escape sequences are only supported in\ndouble-quoted strings, and some Unicode characters need to be represented as\nescape sequences.\nThe emitter works by pushing \"events\" to a queue. Events are things like \"begin\nmapping\", \"begin mapping key\", \"begin mapping value\", \"end mapping\", and so on,\nand the emitter writes to the output when it has enough information to determine\nthe appropriate style.\nThis is implemented in libyaml as an \"analysis\" step that happens for each event\nbefore the corresponding YAML is written to the output.\n\nThe analysis step populates the emitter-&gt;anchor_data, emitter-&gt;tag_data, and\nemitter-&gt;scalar_data fields depending on the event type. Those fields that can\nbe NULL are C strings, and they refer to the strings contained within the\nevent. But the event comes from a queue owned by yaml_emitter_t. This is\ngreat design in the C library, because it makes the analysis step extremely\ncheap - no strings are duplicated, only \"borrowed\".\nSo how do we express the analysis fields in safe Rust? Blindly porting the C\napproach to Rust would result in yaml_emitter_t becoming self-referential,\nsince the analysis pointers would either point into the event queue or into an\nevent that was just popped from the queue, making it impossible to represent\nthat lifetime on yaml_emitter_t itself.\nKey Insight: Every time yaml_emitter_analyze_event() is called, it resets\nany previous analysis results. It is called exactly once per event. Aha! What if\nthe results of the analysis was a return value from\nyaml_emitter_analyze_event(), instead of modifying fields on the emitter?\n\nWonderful! Now the Analysis&lt;'a&gt; struct just needs to be passed into any\nemitter function that needs the analysis as an extra parameter. Thankfully no\npublic API function on the emitter relies on analysis having happened\npreviously, so threading that argument through the emitter code is fairly\ntrivial, and guaranteed bug-free due to lifetime annotations, in the sense that\nit is not possible for any part of the emitter to use the analysis of one event\nduring the emission of another event.\nOn the one hand, this change is something that we're forced to do by Rust,\nbecause it would not be possible to make the borrow checker happy without it. On\nthe other hand, the Rust compiler actually nudges us to choose a better design\nthan the original.\nWhy is this beneficial? Why do we accept such blatant tyranny by the cruel and\ncold-hearted borrow checker?\nWell, see, reading the original source code for libyaml was hard. Upon seeing\nthe anchor_data, tag_data, and scalar_data fields of yaml_emitter_t, the\nfirst thing any reader or maintainer has to do is figure out how those pointers\nare used and when they are valid. This required a whole bunch of forensics,\nwhich would have to happen again and again every time someone new looked at the\ncode, and \"someone new\" also includes \"future you\".\nThe original design from the C code could have been ported verbatim to Rust. But\nit would require a lot of unsafe code, which would have made it very obvious\nthat some cognitive overhead was being incurred. By choosing a design that works\nin safe Rust, that cognitive overhead has been moved to a statically verified\ninvariant that is plainly visible in the source code. The new signature of\nyaml_emitter_analyze_event plainly documents that Analysis&lt;'a&gt; contains\nreferences that are coming from a yaml_event_t with lifetime 'a.\nError handling\nOne of my goals with libyaml-safer was to provide near perfect error fidelity\ncompared with libyaml.\nMercifully, C does not have exceptions. They are easily among the top 20 of\nhumanity's mistakes, and don't even come for me because I will die on this hill.\nInstead, C code usually reports errors by returning an error code, and this is\nalready a primitive version of what Rust does. The flow around error handling is\nsurprisingly similar between well-structured C code and idiomatic Rust code.\nRust has the \"try\" operator ? to make things easier, and one of the important\naffordances of unsafe-libyaml (Rust) over libyaml (C) is that integer return\ncodes are replaced with a bespoke Success struct. Replacing this with\nResult turned out to be pretty\ntrivial.\nBut wait a minute... We can't just use the ? straight away. It checks if an\nerror occurred and returns early from the function if it did, but C does not\nhave RAII, so resources need to be released as well before returning. This is\nthe one remaining valid use case of goto in the C language, and it is often\nactually the most sustainable way to deal with errors. More civilized languages\n(such as Rust) don't even have this misfeature.\n\nThus, in order to start leveraging the error handling features of Rust, all\nthings that own memory must first be converted to RAII objects, such as\nString, Vec, VecDeque, etc.\nAfter that, there is the problem of actually reporting the error.\nRust Results are rich: They can contain an error value of your choice, so you\ncan provide the best possible message for the users, giving them all the context\nthey need. C does not have this option built in, and most libraries opt for\nsimply returning an error code, and then sometimes allowing the programmer to\nobtain more information about the error after the fact.\nIn libyaml, this looks like so:\n\nWhen an error occurs, the relevant function (such as yaml_parser_parse()) sets\nthe error fields (yaml_set_parser_error()), and returns an integer indicating\nthat an error occurred. The user is then expected to access these fields to\ndetermine what the error was and where in the input it occurred.\nIn Rust, we don't want a special \"error\" state for the parser. Ideally, we want\nto be able to return a self-contained error instead, which can then have all the\nusual niceties, like an implementation of std::fmt::Display.\nNote also that the reported error is not necessarily a \"parse error\". Lots of\nerrors can occur that aren't typically considered syntax errors: I/O read\nerrors, invalid Unicode, tokenization errors, etc.\nLet's try with some enums:\n\nSo nice, perfect fidelity and high-quality error reporting. Except... On a\n64-bit architecture, the size of the top-level ParserError enum is 88 bytes,\nmostly due to the Mark type, which indicates a location in the input, and\nwhich looks like this:\n\n24 bytes, and each error typically needs 2 marks.\nWhy is the size a problem?\n\nEven the minimal Result&lt;(), ParserError&gt; can never be returned in a register.\nEvery function that encounters a Result&lt;T, ParserError&gt; and wants to return\nResult&lt;U, ParserError&gt; needs to re-wrap the return value, no matter if an\nerror occurred or not, leading to a lot of copying of large structs in stack\nmemory.\nWhile LLVM will inline calls to memcpy() below 128\nbytes,\ninstructions to copy these values are still generated.\n\nThe parser makes a huge number of tiny calls, and each of them can fail. Every\ntime it needs a new token, it might also need a new character, meaning it might\nalso need another byte from the input buffer, meaning it might also need to\nperform a read() operation from the input, which can fail with\nstd::io::Error, or with a Unicode decoding error, or with a tokenization\nerror, and finally a parser error.\nAll in all, a very large error type like this is... not great.\nThere are a couple of options for moving forward:\n\nMimic the libyaml style of errors, and set error codes on the parser object\nitself. This gives a much less ergonomic API, or would introduce a lifetime\nparameter on all return values that isn't very nice.\nCodegolfing the above enums to reduce the size. Not much can be won without\nlosing fidelity, but it could probably get down to about 64 bytes.\nWrap the error in a Box, reducing the size to only 8 bytes on 64-bit\nplatforms. The heap allocation isn't great, but it would only happen in error\nscenarios, so it's trading some efficiency in the error path for a faster\n\"happy\" path.\nAccept that this is our life now and move on.\n\nAll compromises, either in usability or performance.\nI benchmarked options (3) and (4) against each other in the happy path, and\nthere wasn't much difference. But it still feels wrong, and committing to an\n\"inefficient\" public API where the user can see the inner workings of the error\nenums is a semver hazard, so for now I've chosen an API that supports both\nimplementations, and boxed (3) under the hood.\nZooming out, it's worth noting that\nserde_yaml::Error\nhas actually chosen (3), a boxed error, which is an indication that I am not the\nonly person in the world in considering this an acceptable tradeoff.\nFreebies\nRust, being a younger language, has a much richer standard library. This means\nthat several things that are implemented manually in libyaml can be replaced\nwith standard facilities.\n\nUTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding/decoding. These aren't particularly complicated, but\nthe Rust standard library is likely to be better optimized (for example, using\nSIMD when available).\nRather than user-provided unsafe callbacks, input and output can be handled by\nthe std::io::Read and std::io::Write traits. This gives users the ability\nto plug anything in there, such as tty streams, network streams, etc., with no\nextra effort.\nThe parser requires some input buffering to perform correct decoding, but\nlibyaml is practically forced to do this by itself, even when the input is\nalready buffered by the user. By using the std::io::BufRead trait, an entire\nintermediate buffer was eliminated from the parser, meaning that if the data\nis already coming from an in-memory buffer, the unnecessary copy is elided.\n\nTesting\nunsafe-libyaml is automatically tested against the official YAML test\nsuite. Having this comprehensive test\nsuite was an absolute necessity when porting to safe Rust, and I would not have\ndared to embark on this endeavor without it.\nFor every change to the code, I was able to run the full test suite and verify\nthat everything was as it should be. And even though the code was ported with a\ntrue dedication to matching the original semantics, and even the general \"shape\"\nof the API, many things could go wrong - particularly around flow control and\nerrors. See, the use of gotos is emulated by c2rust using complicated\nloop/match/break constructs, all of which went away completely, replaced by\nRust's \"try\" operator, ?. Even trivial changes are an opportunity for bugs to\nsneak in, and even moreso when there are hundreds.\nEven though it is much easier to write correct code in safe Rust than in C,\nlogic bugs are obviously just as possible, particularly when performing very\nlarge scale refactoring.\nPerformance\nIn order to compare the performance of unsafe-libyaml and the safe Rust port, I\nfound a relatively large YAML document (~700 KiB) and built a very simple\nbenchmark using Criterion.\nIn short:\nunsafe-libyamllibyaml-safer\nParse 700 KiB document38.258 ms37.447 ms\nEmit 700 KiB document18.491 ms17.549 ms\n\nHold for applause.\nThese benchmarks were run on an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X 16-Core CPU (3.5 GHz) running\nWindows 11.\nAnalysis\n\nImportant: While I do consistently get slightly faster times for\nlibyaml-safer, I don't consider this benchmark to be conclusive in any way.\nWhat these numbers do indicate is that the port to safe, idiomatic Rust does\nnot produce meaningfully slower code.\n\nThe justification for \"unsafe\" C and C++ libraries is often that some\nperformance is left on the table with safe Rust, primarily due to bounds\nchecking. On modern hardware this justification has always seemed a bit\nsuspicious to me, and I think this is another piece of (circumstantial)\nevidence that it often just doesn't matter in practice.\nIt's certainly possible to build things where bounds checking makes a\ndifference. This just isn't that.\n\n\nIf libyaml-safer is consistently faster for all workloads, here are some\npossible explanations:\n\nC libyaml needs to assert on a couple of invariants (such as pointers not\nbeing NULL), and unsafe-libyaml performs these assertions even in release\nmode. Some of these invariants are statically checked in safe Rust, where\n&amp;T can never be \"NULL\".\nDue to the use of std::io::BufRead in the parser, the parser performs\nfewer in-memory copies.\n\n\nEven if this benchmark is completely bogus, the performance of libyaml-safer\nis still well within tolerance for what is acceptable, considering the massive\nincrease in maintainability and safety\nZero effort was made to optimize things, other than just not choosing\nobviously slower safe alternatives.\n\nOne optimization that might make sense is to implement more efficient\nlookahead in the parser. Currently, there are many places where the scanner\nand parser perform many redundant bounds checks on the input buffer.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was a lot of fun.\nI think, to me, and to a lot of software engineers who came from a C++\nbackground, using Rust is not just about nebulous promises of safety and\ncorrectness.\nIt's about bringing the joy back into programming.\nWe all like to design pretty, user-friendly APIs, we all like to produce things\nthat just feel high quality. Many of us don't get to do that, because the\nrealities of our industry often do not permit it. And so, does it spark joy?\nCoding in Rust feels like having your cake and eating it too. When people are\nproductive in Rust, it is because it makes many things that used to be hard -\nthings that cause tears, blood, and burnout - are no longer as hard. The result\nis not just safer and easier, it is also just as performant. So please - join\nus.\nFootnotes\n\nIn this post I have preserved type names and function names from\nunsafe-libyaml, but as part of porting to idiomatic Rust, I also did\nrename all types and enums following idiomatic Rust conventions.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/libyaml-safer/","title":"libyaml-safer"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":41,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/introducing-werk/":{"body":1463,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/libyaml-safer/":{"body":1837,"title":2}},"length":4},"lang":"English"}
